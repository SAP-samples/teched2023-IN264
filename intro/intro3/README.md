# SAP S/4Hana Cloud System configuration (for your information only)

## Overview
In the exercises, we will be using the Purchase Requisition APIs in SAP S/4HANA. <br>
To do so, we need a communication arrangement in SAP S/4HANA with valid system, user and communication scenario.<br>
We then need to maintain the details of the API and communication user credentials in the SAP BTP Subaccount under destinations to be able to call the APIs from the SAP Build Process Automation. <br><br>

For our exerscie today, this is already created in the SAP S/4HANA.
Below is the sample screenshot for reference.
